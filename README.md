To run this app you need to run npm i in the terminal to install all the dependencies.

You will need to uncomment the methodes in the weather.service.ts and app.component.ts if you are going to use the api to get your data since at the moment all the values are hard coded so the app does not show a blank screen hwne you run ng serve.

Depending on when you clone this app the api key might not work and you will need to provide your own key. Also there are only 100 calls per month on the free version provided in this code.
